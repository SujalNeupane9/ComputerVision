# ComputerVision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that aims to enable computers to interpret and understand visual data from the world around us. This involves using algorithms and mathematical models to analyze and extract information from images and videos. Computer vision has a wide range of applications, including object recognition, face detection, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and more.

Here's a brief introduction to some of the main branches of computer vision:

* **Image processing**: This branch deals with the manipulation of digital images using various algorithms and techniques to enhance their quality or extract useful information.

* **Object recognition**: This involves identifying objects in images or videos and classifying them into different categories based on their features and characteristics.

* **Motion analysis**: This branch deals with analyzing the motion of objects in videos, including tracking their movements and predicting their future positions.

* **3D reconstruction**: This involves creating a 3D model of an object or scene from one or more 2D images, using techniques such as stereo vision or structure from motion.

* **Scene understanding**: This branch aims to enable computers to understand the context and meaning of a scene by analyzing the relationships between objects, their spatial layout, and other factors.
